title of the project thesis: Einsatz von Deep-Learning-Verfahren zur Ãœberwachung von Schraubprozessen in der Endmontage von Elektromotoren

Abstract: Monitoring screw-in process curves using deep learning algorithm has the potential to achieve higher accuracy differentiating between a "good" and a "bad" screw-in process compared to conventinal monitoring methods. Deep Learing models that are trained with labeled can also deliver information about specific disturbances right after the screw-in process.

tasks in this thesis:
- Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoder for a unsupervised binary classification with screw-in process curves (torque-time-curves)
- Using 1D-Convolutional-Neural-Network for multi-class classification with screw-in process curves (torque-time-curves)
